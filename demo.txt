## transactional systems.
here we can use this Api not only for product recommendations
in Aap we have multiple microservies running any service that want
the customer segmentation data they can use this.
for example there is a transaction happening using this api we
can identify that the customer is high-worth customer 
then this can also bring chance to provide extra discount.

## introduction
  * start with this: so far in Aap the Recommendation systems we are having
    are static  instead of doing that using the machine learning Methadologies
    supraja already did the customer segmentation.we want to leverage the segmentation
    that has been done and improvise the recommendations in such a way that 
    you can bring the more personalization to the recommendations per customer.
    At the same time it is an oppurtunity for you to expose the data to enterprise.
    
 
  1-> removing the dynamic pricing 
  by removing the above add this
    * in Aap majority are transactional systems multiple micro services are running
     in Real time when a transaction is happening if you want to know
     what type of customer is and what are frequently brought items
     you can use this.
