## Reason to use the message broker
  1. we have Booking which is highly scaled and our notification service 
     not very highly scaled and also we don't want to send emails immediately
     when the booking is created then if the notification service is getting 
     high number of QPS then the load on the database will increase . so
     if we use the message brokers the interaction with the notification service
     is avoided and the notification service can pull each request from the meeage 
     queue and send that emails.
